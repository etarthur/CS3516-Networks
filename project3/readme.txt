To run code compile on linux command line with:
	make 
	
Then run by entering:
	./project3

The output will be the tables of each node only when they are updated, therefore the last table of each node is the final version. If you want timestamps run with trace level of 2, otherwise use 0.
	
Enter a trace level, for only table output use 1 or 0, for debugging use 2. Tables are printed when they are initalized and
whenever they update. Therefore the last version of each table printed out is the final table. 

The comments on the code are only in node0 this is because the code is identical across all files except for changing node number 
depending on .c file in. Therefore consult only node0.c for comments or reference about the code.
